# Telco Customer Churn Prediction

This project builds a complete machine learning pipeline to predict whether a customer will churn using the **Telco Customer Churn** dataset. The task is a **binary classification** problem built using **Scikit-learn**, with models including **Logistic Regression** and **Random Forest**.

## Dataset

- **Source**: [Kaggle - Telco Customer Churn](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn)
- **Target Variable**: `Churn` (Yes/No)
- **Features**: Customer demographic info, account details, service subscriptions, etc.

## Objective

To:
- Preprocess the dataset (cleaning, encoding, scaling)
- Train classification models using Scikit-learn
- Perform hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV
- Evaluate model performance using classification metrics
- Save the final model pipeline for reuse

## Tools & Libraries

- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Joblib
